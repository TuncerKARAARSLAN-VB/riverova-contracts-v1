# 🤝 Contributing to Riverova

Riverova is committed to open-source development and fostering a decentralized ecosystem. We welcome contributions from the community to help us build the DAO Governance and NFT Certification core.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Contribute

### 1. Code of Conduct

Please review and adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for everyone.

### 2. Reporting Bugs or Suggestions

For major issues, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. For small fixes, feel free to open a pull request.

### 3. Submission Guidelines

* **Proposals:** Contributions should align with the core mission of enabling decentralized, verifiable education.
* **Solidity:** All smart contract contributions must be written in the latest stable Solidity version (currently 0.8.x).
* **Testing:** All features or bug fixes must include unit tests (using Hardhat/Foundry) with high code coverage.
* **Security:** Given the financial and governance implications of these contracts, security best practices are paramount. Large feature changes will require a formal audit process.

### 4. Community Governance (DAO)

As we transition from V1 to V2, all major protocol changes will be submitted for a vote by Level 5+ Community Leaders via the Riverova DAO. Future code contributions will follow the outcome of these votes.

Thank you for helping us build the future of education!
